    ///
    /// `timedOut` distinguishes a hang (a wedged lane or a drain-loop idle bailout) from a genuine pass or property failure, so the runner reports the hang as a timeout rather than dressing it up as a confirmed race. A timed-out run always has `passed == false`.

    /// Reduces a counterexample in three passes, each targeting a different encoder set. The only thing that varies between the two checkers is `execute`.
    ///
    /// The three-pass structure is deliberate: preemptive evaluation is non-deterministic (GCD thread preemption), so each probe requires multiple repetitions to confirm. Phased reduction ensures the most impactful transformations run first before budget is spent on fine-tuning.
    ///
    /// **Pass 1 — Lane Collapse.** Drives lane markers to zero, moving commands into the sequential prefix. Prefix commands execute deterministically (no scheduling noise), so a longer prefix produces counterexamples that are easier to reproduce and reason about. Running lane collapse first also reduces the repetition cost of later passes — fewer concurrent commands means less non-deterministic scheduling per evaluation. (The cooperative runner skips this pre-pass because its schedule is choice-encoded and fully deterministic.)
    ///
    /// **Pass 2 — Structural.** Deletion, migration, and substitution. Removes unnecessary commands and simplifies arguments, operating on the already-collapsed trace so deletions target only commands genuinely needed for the failure.
    ///
    /// **Pass 3 — Value Minimization.** All remaining encoders. Simplifies command arguments toward their semantic simplest form. Runs with a tighter budget (1 stall, 5s) since the structural shape is already minimal.
